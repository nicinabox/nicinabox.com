    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>If you know about Wordpress' shortcodes, then this should already be familiar to you. In any case, read on my gallant friend.</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>[overview]</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>From the Wordpress Shortcode API:
<blockquote><p>It enables plugin developers to create special kinds of content (e.g. forms, content generators) that users can attach to certain pages by adding the corresponding shortcode into the page text.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nicinabox/shortcode.js">shortcode.js</a> is similar, except it's JavaScript based and it works basically anywhere. It's essentially a modular find-and-replace in the page. You find the shortcode, then replace it with something that can be added via JavaScript--pretty much anything. You could add a form, gallery, table of contents, or some special functionality to the page just with <code>[gallery id="123"]</code>.</p>

<h2>How does it help?</h2>

<p>It's very useful in the case where one might be using a typical WYSIWG/M editor. Many editors don't support (or make it very difficult) to add rich functionality. Since the placeholder shortcode is just a string, an editor won't try to do anything to it.</p>

<p>By shifting the replacement to the frontend, not only does the action happen asynchronously, it works in pretty much any environment. You're not locked down to this backend language or that one. Honey badger don't care. You will need jQuery, however (a future version could easily remove this dependency).</p>

    <link href="http://nicinabox.com/blog/how-hatchpass-works/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-25T20:45:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicinabox.com/blog/how-hatchpass-works</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4><a href="http://beta.hatchpass.org">Hatchpass</a> is a password tool I built to help with the password problem--or, using the same password everywhere. It creates complex, pseudo-random, unique passwords. You don't have to remember any of them.</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="/images/posts/hatchpass.png"></p>

<p>Now, many would say that the the only way to solve the password problem is to absolve passwords altogether. And, while this is probably true, they're not going away any time soon.</p>

<p>It's very common that users will reuse the same password across the web on accounts varying security, from banks to Myspace. The problem is that if any one account is compromised, an attacker could have access to any number of different accounts, including high risk ones.</p>

<h2>How is this different than LastPass, 1Password, etc?</h2>

<p>These 3rd party services store your password. That makes them inherently untrustworthy. Hatchpass does not store anything. Since you can easily recreate <strong>your</strong> passwords, storage is an unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>There is no sign up, no account, no "user". You simply use it.</p>

<p>They also generate actual random passwords. Since they're random, they have to be stored. You can't get that random password again.</p>

<h2>I get it. How does this help me?</h2>

<p>Hatchpass generates unique passwords. The passwords aren't <em>randomly</em> generated, however. They're mathematically created based on an algorithm. By combining the same pieces of information (a key, password, and domain), you'll always get the same generated password.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/hatchpass-settings.png"></p>

<p>Let me explain more about these pieces.</p>

<h3>The key</h3>

<p>Upon visiting, a pseudo-random key will be generated for you. It's a 5 character string based on the time you visited (to the millisecond). This key is effectively unique to you and helps randomize the algorithm.</p>

<h3>The master password</h3>

<p>This is what makes Hatchpass easy to use. If you're already using the same password on every site, this is all you really need to remember. Hatchpass basically translates this (probably simple) password into a complex password. You aren't expected to remember the generated passwords, you can always comeback and regenerate it.</p>

<p>Remember, the best kept secret is one nobody knows.</p>

<h3>The domain</h3>

<p>This is the site you want to log in to. Once you type your password and the domain, a password will be created on the fly. <strong>For a given key, password, and domain, you will always get the same password.</strong></p>

<p>This is important. Remember, the generated passwords <strong>aren't random</strong>. They're mathematically recreatable with the information you provided. Since your password (and probably key) are secret, you don't need to worry about someone having the same generated password as you. The key randomizes this.</p>

<h2>But, security!</h2>

<p>Hatchpass is a JavaScript application (Backbone to be exact). It has no database. In fact, nothing is ever even sent to the server. Once you've loaded the page, all calculations are done <strong>in your browser</strong>.</p>

<p>localStorage is utilized to save settings and recent domains. If you're unfamiliar with localStorage, this means that everything is stored right in your browser, similar to a cookie. It's not a cookie, however, and won't be cleared if you clear your cookies.</p>

<p>It can't be accessed by other sites or applications. It's specific to the Hatchpass domain and only it can see the settings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/hatchpass-recent.png"></p>

<h2>Okay, but how do I use it?</h2>

<p>When you register on a site, open up Hatchpass, type the domain name, and copypasta the password into the registration form. Whenever you want to login again, open Hatchpass, type the domain, copypasta. Easy peasy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/hatchpass-generated.png"></p>

<p>Yes, it's a little tedious. Make it a habit and you'll be used to it in no time. Your real life is at stake here.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Save your settings</strong> unless you're on a public computer. View the Settings pane and turn on "Save All". This will save all your settings and your master password. Upon subsequent visits, all you need to do is type the domain you want to log in to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bookmark it</strong> and put it in your url bar, or some place convenient. If you use an iPhone, save it on your homescreen. It's a fullscreen, touch enabled web app.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memorize your key.</strong> If you are away from your computer and you need to login to a site that you've used Hatchpass to generate the password with, the key and the master password are the most critical pieces of information. You can't get the same password without them.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>That's all!</h2>

<p>I've been using Hatchpass daily for over a couple years now. I'd love to hear your feedback if you're using it (or if you're not). I know it's not a perfect solution, but it's an area that needs improvement.</p>

    <link href="http://nicinabox.com/blog/superslides-a-fullscreen-jquery-slider/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-22T11:31:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicinabox.com/blog/superslides-a-fullscreen-jquery-slider</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Back in April 2012 I started working on a fullscreen JavaScript slider called <a href="http://nicinabox.github.com/superslides/">Superslides</a>. It's had some interest, so I wanted to officially announce it here.</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>So, yeah, it's just what it sounds like: a full screen slider (or carousel if you prefer that). I wasn't happy with the current state of fullscreen sliders. Supersized is bloated and hasn't been updated in quite a while. It was cumbersome to work with and didn't fit my needs, so I began work on this project. It's light (only 4kb) and easy to use. Check of the documentation on Github.</p>

<p>One of my goals for this project is that it stays light on features. There's not something for everyone. It's horizontal slider and its fullscreen. Instead, I gave a lot of attention to performance and control. It's got support for hardware acceleration in lacking browsers and a sweet API that you can hook in to.</p>

<p>I've learned a lot about JavaScript on this project. When I find something that could make the code clearer or the API easier to use, I'll release and update. I regularly maintain it and respond to issues on <a href="https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides">Github</a>.</p>

<p>If you've used it or want to give feedback (please do!), suggest a feature, note a bug, or whatehaveyou, just post an issue on Github.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <link href="http://nicinabox.com/blog/geektool-scripts/"/>
    <updated>2009-04-19T22:29:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicinabox.com/blog/geektool-scripts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE 8/15/2011:</strong> Most of these scripts have been <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/geeklets2">repackaged in a gem</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><nav class="try">
  <a class="download" href="https://github.com/nicinabox/Geektool-Scripts/zipball/master">Download <small>v1.7 (Github)</small></a>
</nav></p>

<p>These are an ever growing compilation of scripts and code snippets that I have written or collected in a format that’s easy to understand and use. If you need help feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:nic@nicinabox.com">nic@nicinabox.com</a>, <strong>but please read the documentation first</strong>.</p>

<p>I encourage you to checkout some of the Desktop screenshots on Flickr (some are very nice!) for ideas.If you have a script or something clever you'd like to add to this collection, please contact me.</p>

<p>These commands require that you actually install the scripts. Some are built into the system, but most are custom. For more information, check <code>readme.html</code> included in the download.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>This package includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network info</li>
<li>Unread Gmail</li>
<li>Uptime</li>
<li>Calendar (with current day denoted)</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>System Stats</li>
<li>Recent Music plays</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installing the scripts</h2>

<p>Note: this step can be skipped if you're using the gem.</p>

<p>Copy files to a directory in your PATH. I recommend <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. This will make the commands accessible by just typing the name of it, eg.
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ airport</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>That's it!</p>

<h2>Using the scripts</h2>

<p>After you've got them installed you'll want to pop open Geektool and enter the command in the Command field. You should immediately see output on your desktop. For time sensitive scripts like weather you'll probably want to set a refresh time of 30-60 seconds.</p>

<p>If you're using the gem and RVM you need to include and extra line in the command. Geektool runs in a subshell and does not use custom PATHs specified in your <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.profile</code>. Simply tell Geektool to use your profile as the source of the subshell (the period means "source").</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>command.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>. /Users/nic/.bash_profile <span class="c"># be sure to include this part if using the gem</span>
</span><span class='line'>weather -z 60614
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Obviously substitute my username for your own shortname.</p>
